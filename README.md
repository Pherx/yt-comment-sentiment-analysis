# yt-comment-sentiment-analysis
This repository is for a Text Mining Project on performing a sentiment analysis of Machine Learning videos in Bahasa Indonesia.

Machine Learning is not a common subject among Indonesia Citizens, so with this project I decided to find out what is their take on Machine Learning. This is done by sentimentally analyzing comments from youtube videos around Machine Learning in Indonesia. I try to avoid tutorial videos since the comments of the video is mostly "Thank you"s which will affect the result.
